# Overview

1. **Basic usage examples** demonstrate fundamental usage.
Learn how to perform Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO), Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and Joint Architecture and Hyperparameter Search (JAHS).
Understand how to analyze runs on a basic level.

2. **Efficiency examples** showcase how to enhance efficiency in NePS.
Learn about expert priors, multi-fidelity, and parallelization to streamline your pipeline and optimize search processes.

3. **Convenience examples** show tensorboard compatibility and its integration, explore the compatibility with PyTorch Lightning, see the declarative API, understand file management within the evaluate pipeline function used in NePS.

4. **Experimental examples** tailored for NePS contributors. These examples provide insights and practices for experimental scenarios.

5. **Real-world examples** demonstrate how to apply NePS to real-world problems.
