"""
NOTE!!! This code is not meant to be executed.
It is only to serve as a template to help interface NePS with an existing ML/DL pipeline.

The following script is designed as a template for using NePS.
It describes the crucial components that a user needs to provide in order to interface
a NePS optimizer.

The 2 crucial components are:
* The search space, called the `pipeline_space` in NePS
  * This defines the set of hyperparameters that the optimizer will search over
  * This declaration also allows injecting priors in the form of defaults per hyperparameter
* The `run_pipeline` function
  * This function is called by the optimizer and is responsible for running the pipeline
  * The function should at the minimum expect the hyperparameters as keyword arguments
  * The function should return the loss of the pipeline as a float
    * If the return value is a dictionary, it should have a key called "loss" with the loss as a float


Overall, running an optimizer from NePS involves 4 clear steps:
1. Importing neccessary packages including neps.
2. Designing the search space as a dictionary.
3. Creating the run_pipeline and returning the loss and other wanted metrics.
4. Using neps run with the optimizer of choice.
