Welcome to NePS, a powerful and flexible Python library for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) with its primary goal: **make HPO and NAS usable for deep learners in practice**.

NePS houses recently published and also well-established algorithms that can all be run massively parallel on distributed setups, with tools to analyze runs, restart runs, etc., all **tailored to the needs of deep learning experts**.

Take a look at our [documentation](https://automl.github.io/neps/latest/) for all the details on how to use NePS!

## Key Features

In addition to the features offered by traditional HPO and NAS libraries, NePS, e.g., stands out with:


1. [**Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) with Prior Knowledge and Cheap Proxies:**](neps_examples/template/priorband_template.py) <br /> <br />
NePS excels in efficiently tuning hyperparameters using algorithms that enable users to make use of their prior knowledge within the search space. This is leveraged by the insights presented in:
     - [PriorBand: Practical Hyperparameter Optimization in the Age of Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12370)
     - [Ï€BO: Augmenting Acquisition Functions with User Beliefs for Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11051) <br /> <br />
1. [**Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with General Search Spaces:**](neps_examples/basic_usage/architecture.py) <br /> <br />
    NePS is equipped to handle context-free grammar search spaces, providing advanced capabilities for designing and optimizing architectures. this is leveraged by the insights presented in:
     - [Construction of Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search Spaces based on Context-free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01842) <br /> <br />
1. [**Easy Parallelization and Design Tailored to DL:**](https://automl.github.io/neps/latest/examples/efficiency/) <br /> <br />
     NePS simplifies the process of parallelizing optimization tasks both on individual computers and in distributed
     computing environments. As NePS is made for deep learners, all technical choices are made with DL in mind and common
     DL tools such as Tensorboard are [embraced](https://automl.github.io/neps/latest/reference/analyse/#visualizing-results).

## Installation

To install the latest release from PyPI run

```bash
pip install neural-pipeline-search
```

To get the latest version from Github run

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/automl/neps.git
```

## Basic Usage

Using `neps` always follows the same pattern:

1. Define a `run_pipeline` function capable of evaluating different architectural and/or hyperparameter configurations
   for your problem.
1. Define a search space named `pipeline_space` of those Parameters e.g. via a dictionary
1. Call `neps.run` to optimize `run_pipeline` over `pipeline_space`

In code, the usage pattern can look like this:

```python
import neps
import logging


# 1. Define a function that accepts hyperparameters and computes the validation error
def run_pipeline(
    hyperparameter_a: float, hyperparameter_b: int, architecture_parameter: str
) -> dict:
    # Create your model
    model = MyModel(architecture_parameter)

    # Train and evaluate the model with your training pipeline
    validation_error = train_and_eval(
        model, hyperparameter_a, hyperparameter_b
    )
    return validation_error


# 2. Define a search space of parameters; use the same parameter names as in run_pipeline
pipeline_space = dict(
    hyperparameter_a=neps.FloatParameter(
        lower=0.001, upper=0.1, log=True  # The search space is sampled in log space
    ),
    hyperparameter_b=neps.IntegerParameter(lower=1, upper=42),
    architecture_parameter=neps.CategoricalParameter(["option_a", "option_b"]),
)


# 3. Run the NePS optimization
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
neps.run(
    run_pipeline=run_pipeline,
    pipeline_space=pipeline_space,
    root_directory="path/to/save/results",  # Replace with the actual path.
    max_evaluations_total=100,
)
```
## Declarative Usage

NePS offers a declarative approach to efficiently manage experiments. This method is particularly suitable for
conducting and managing a large number of experiments with different settings. Below is the example from Basic Usage:
```yaml
run_pipeline:
  path: path/to/your/run_pipeline.py  # Path to the function file
  name: run_pipeline              # Function name within the file
root_directory: "path/to/save/results"
pipeline_space:
  hyperparameter_a:
    lower: 1e-3
    upper: 1e-1
    log: True  # Log scale for learning rate
  hyperparameter_b:
    lower: 1
    upper: 42
  architecture_parameter:
    choices: [option_a, option_b]

max_evaluations_total: 100
```
```bash
neps run --run-args path/to/your/config.yaml
```
