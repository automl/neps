Welcome to NePS, a powerful and flexible Python library for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) with its primary goal: enable HPO adoption in practice for deep learners!

NePS houses recently published and some more well-established algorithms that are all capable of being run massively parallel on any distributed setup, with tools to analyze runs, restart runs, etc.

Take a look at our [documentation](https://automl.github.io/neps/latest/) and continue following through current README for instructions on how to use NePS!


## Key Features

In addition to the common features offered by traditional HPO and NAS libraries, NePS stands out with the following key features:

1. [**Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) With Prior Knowledge:**](neps_examples/template/priorband_template.py)
    - NePS excels in efficiently tuning hyperparameters using algorithms that enable users to make use of their prior knowledge within the search space. This is leveraged by the insights presented in:
        - [PriorBand: Practical Hyperparameter Optimization in the Age of Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12370)
        - [Ï€BO: Augmenting Acquisition Functions with User Beliefs for Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11051)

2. [**Neural Architecture Search (NAS) With Context-free Grammar Search Spaces:**](neps_examples/basic_usage/architecture.py)
    - NePS is equipped to handle context-free grammar search spaces, providing advanced capabilities for designing and optimizing architectures. this is leveraged by the insights presented in:
        - [Construction of Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search Spaces based on Context-free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01842)

3. [**Easy Parallelization and Resumption of Runs:**](docs/parallelization.md)
      - NePS simplifies the process of parallelizing optimization tasks both on individual computers and in distributed
   computing environments. It also allows users to conveniently resume these optimization tasks after completion to
   ensure a seamless and efficient workflow for long-running experiments.

4. [**Seamless User Code Integration:**](neps_examples/template/)
    - NePS's modular design ensures flexibility and extensibility. Integrate NePS effortlessly into existing machine learning workflows.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Using pip:

```bash
pip install neural-pipeline-search
```

> Note: As indicated with the `v0.x.x` version number, NePS is early stage code and APIs might change in the future.

### 2. Basic Usage

Using `neps` always follows the same pattern:

1. Define a `run_pipeline` function capable of evaluating different architectural and/or hyperparameter configurations
   for your problem.
2. Define a search space named `pipeline_space` of those Parameters e.g. via a dictionary
3. Call `neps.run` to optimize `run_pipeline` over `pipeline_space`

In code, the usage pattern can look like this:

```python
import neps
import logging


# 1. Define a function that accepts hyperparameters and computes the validation error
def run_pipeline(
    hyperparameter_a: float, hyperparameter_b: int, architecture_parameter: str
) -> dict:
    # Create your model
    model = MyModel(architecture_parameter)

    # Train and evaluate the model with your training pipeline
    validation_error, training_error = train_and_eval(
        model, hyperparameter_a, hyperparameter_b
    )

    return {  # dict or float(validation error)
        "loss": validation_error,
        "info_dict": {
            "training_error": training_error
            # + Other metrics
        },
    }


# 2. Define a search space of parameters; use the same names for the parameters as in run_pipeline
pipeline_space = dict(
    hyperparameter_b=neps.IntegerParameter(
        lower=1, upper=42, is_fidelity=True
    ),  # Mark 'is_fidelity' as true for a multi-fidelity approach.
    hyperparameter_a=neps.FloatParameter(
        lower=0.001, upper=0.1, log=True
    ),  # If True, the search space is sampled in log space.
    architecture_parameter=neps.CategoricalParameter(
        ["option_a", "option_b", "option_c"]
    ),
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 3. Run the NePS optimization
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    neps.run(
        run_pipeline=run_pipeline,
        pipeline_space=pipeline_space,
        root_directory="path/to/save/results",  # Replace with the actual path.
        max_evaluations_total=100,
        searcher="hyperband"  # Optional specifies the search strategy,
        # otherwise NePs decides based on your data.
    )
```
