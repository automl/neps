Welcome to NePS, a powerful and flexible Python library for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) that **makes HPO and NAS practical for deep learners**.

NePS houses recently published and also well-established algorithms that can all be run massively parallel on distributed setups and, in general, NePS is tailored to the needs of deep learning experts.

To learn about NePS, check-out [the documentation](https://automl.github.io/neps/latest/), [our examples](neps_examples/), or a [colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11IOhkmMKsIUhWbHyMYzT0v786O9TPWlH?usp=sharing).

## Key Features

In addition to the features offered by traditional HPO and NAS libraries, NePS stands out with:

1. **Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) Efficient Enough for Deep Learning:** <br />
    NePS excels in efficiently tuning hyperparameters using algorithms that enable users to make use of their prior knowledge, while also using many other efficiency boosters.

1. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with Expressive Search Spaces:** <br />
    NePS provides capabilities for optimizing DL architectures in an expressive and natural fashion.

1. **Zero-effort Parallelization and an Experience Tailored to DL:** <br />
     NePS simplifies the process of parallelizing optimization tasks both on individual computers and in distributed
     computing environments. As NePS is made for deep learners, all technical choices are made with DL in mind and common
     DL tools such as Tensorboard are [embraced](https://automl.github.io/neps/latest/reference/analyse/#visualizing-results).

## Installation

To install the latest release from PyPI run

```bash
pip install neural-pipeline-search
```

## Basic Usage

Using `neps` always follows the same pattern:

1. Define a `evaluate_pipeline` function capable of evaluating different architectural and/or hyperparameter configurations
   for your problem.
1. Define a search space named `pipeline_space` of those Parameters e.g. via a dictionary
1. Call `neps.run(evaluate_pipeline, pipeline_space)`

In code, the usage pattern can look like this:

```python
import neps
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# 1. Define a function that accepts hyperparameters and computes the validation error
def evaluate_pipeline(lr: float, alpha: int, optimizer: str) -> float:
    # Create your model
    model = MyModel(lr=lr, alpha=alpha, optimizer=optimizer)

    # Train and evaluate the model with your training pipeline
    validation_error = train_and_eval(model)
    return validation_error


# 2. Define a search space of parameters; use the same parameter names as in evaluate_pipeline
pipeline_space = dict(
    lr=neps.Float(
        lower=1e-5,
        upper=1e-1,
        log=True,   # Log spaces
        prior=1e-3, # Incorporate you knowledge to help optimization
    ),
    alpha=neps.Integer(lower=1, upper=42),
    optimizer=neps.Categorical(choices=["sgd", "adam"])
)

# 3. Run the NePS optimization
neps.run(
    evaluate_pipeline=evaluate_pipeline,
    pipeline_space=pipeline_space,
    root_directory="path/to/save/results",  # Replace with the actual path.
    max_evaluations_total=100,
)
```
