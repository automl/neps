# Installation

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python version 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 installed. NePS installation will automatically handle
any additional dependencies via pip.

## Install from pip

```bash
pip install neural-pipeline-search
```

> Note: As indicated with the `v0.x.x` version number, NePS is early stage code and APIs might change in the future.

## Install from source

!!! note
We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage dependecies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/automl/neps.git
cd neps
poetry install --no-dev
```
