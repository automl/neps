# Filenamings

To facilitate the process for contributors who may be unfamiliar with the locations to modify file names generated by NePS, we recommend referring to our Filenamings class located in `neps.metahyper.run_file_names.py`.

Within this class, contributors can easily add new file names for their generated files. This approach simplifies the task for those who have not previously contributed to this specific section of the codebase. They can conveniently edit file names, if necessary, without the need to navigate through the entire codebase searching for the specific filename.

In our design, we have adopted a naming convention for variables, which includes:

- Location
- Type
- Purpose

As an illustration:

- `root_directory_results` (str): Represents the name of the result directory located in the root directory.
- `root_file_locker` (str): Represents the name of the locker file located in the root directory.

This structured approach enhances the clarity of file naming and facilitates seamless updates for contributors across different sections of the codebase.
