# Installation for Contributors

There are three required steps and one optional:

1. Optional: Install miniconda and create an environment
1. Install poetry
1. Install the neps package using poetry
1. Activate pre-commit for the repository

For instructions see below.

## 1. Optional: Install miniconda and create an environment

To manage python versions install e.g., miniconda with

```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O install_miniconda.sh
bash install_miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/.conda  # Change to place of preference
rm install_miniconda.sh
```

Consider running `~/.conda/bin/conda init` or `~/.conda/bin/conda init zsh` .

Then finally create the environment and activate it

```bash
conda create -n neps python=3.7.5
conda activate neps
```

## 2. Install poetry

First, install poetry, e.g., via

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Then consider appending

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

to your `.zshrc` / `.bashrc` or alternatively simply running the export manually.

## 3. Install the neps Package Using poetry

Inside the main directory of neps run

```bash
poetry install
```

## 4. Activate pre-commit for the repository

With the python environment used to install the neps package run in the main directory of neps

```bash
pre-commit install
```
